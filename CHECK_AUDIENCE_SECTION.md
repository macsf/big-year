# Check Audience Section for Publishing Status

## Your Current Situation

- ✅ Your app is **verified** (green checkmark in Project Checkup)
- ❌ Users still see "This app is blocked"
- ❌ No Publishing status visible on Overview page

This means your app is likely in **"Testing" mode** and needs to be published.

## Where to Find Publishing Status

The Publishing status is **NOT on the Overview page** in the new Google Auth Platform. It's in the **Audience** section.

### Steps:

1. **Click "Audience" in the left sidebar** (under Google Auth Platform)

2. **On the Audience page, look for:**
   - A section at the top about **"Publishing status"** or **"App availability"**
   - Text that says **"Testing"** or **"Limited to test users"**
   - A list of **"Test users"** (if any are added)
   - A button that says:
     - **"Publish App"**
     - **"Make available to all users"**
     - **"Move to production"**
     - Or a toggle/switch to publish

3. **If you see "Testing" or "Limited to test users":**
   - Click the **"Publish App"** button (or similar)
   - Confirm the publishing
   - Wait 5-10 minutes for changes to propagate

## What You Might See

The Audience page typically shows:
- **Publishing status** at the top (Testing vs In production)
- **Test users** section (users who can access the app in Testing mode)
- **Publish App** button (if in Testing mode)

## If You Still Don't See It

If the Audience page also doesn't show Publishing status:

1. **Check Settings section:**
   - Click "Settings" in the left sidebar
   - Look for publishing or availability options

2. **Check if app is already published:**
   - If you can't find "Publish App" anywhere, the app might already be published
   - But if users still see "blocked", there might be another issue

3. **Organization-level settings:**
   - Since you're using `valdivia.works` organization, check if there are organization-level restrictions
   - Go to organization-level Google Auth Platform settings (if accessible)

## About the Warnings

The warnings in Project Checkup (like "Billing account verification") are usually **not** required for publishing. They're recommendations for better security and compliance, but shouldn't block publishing.

The key is finding the Publishing status in the **Audience** section.
